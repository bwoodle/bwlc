# Guide for solving problems
- Think about problem class:
  - Recursion/divide and conquer 
  - Matrix algebra
  - Linked list
  - Binary tree / Heap
  - Graph
- Think about data structures
  - Dictionary/HashSet (const insertion/lookup)
  - PriorityQueue (minheap is a - b, maxheap is b - a)
  - Queue, Stack, List
- Think about algorithms
  - Tortoise and hare
  - BFS/DFS
- Identify any data pre-processing which may help
  - sorting
  - Counting
  - Building graph / computing edge weights
- Write out edge test cases ahead of time (beginning, end, empty, etc)
- Use a whiteboard for notes, not pen+paper
